# Music Popularity
The primary aim of my project was to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of music from the 1950s to the present day. To achieve this, I utilized various machine learning algorithms, including classification (such as decision trees, SVM, and Naive Bases), clustering, and association rule mining.

Through these methods, I identified and analyzed different musical elements that have experienced significant changes over time. As a result, I discovered that the 90s was the decade with the most significant changes in music. My project provides a comprehensive overview of the factors that have contributed to the evolution of music and how different aspects of music have transformed throughout the decades.

Ultimately, the findings of my project provide valuable insights into the cultural and societal trends that have influenced the evolution of music and how these trends continue to shape the music of today.
